Whack-a-Mole by Tyler Bettilyon
===========================

Personal Amendments
-------------------

In addition to demonstrating a working knowledge of coding for browsers, OO JavaScript, Event Delegation, and closures I challenged myself in the following ways: 

#### No libraries -- CSS 3, HTML 5, and JavaScript

I value having a more complete understanding of whats going on under-the-hood in any context, but particularly in programming. I also believe this is in line with Etsy's philosophy of 'using boring technology'. Finally, I decided to use one new-to-me feature from CSS 3 (animations) and HTML 5 (data-X properties).

#### Experiment With Creative Voice

I wanted to experiment with components of literary writing such as pacing, story-telling and sentence structure. I've read that people who study English Literature seriously then go on to be programmers often write code that is great to read. With that in mind I tried to produce code with a literary mindset. Elements of poetry and prose appear in this codebase.

## Running The Game

Simply open whack-a-mole.html in a modern browser. IE8 doesn't count, Lynx is right out. I recommend playing one round before diving into the code.
